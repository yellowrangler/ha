PROBLEM:  Medical providers do not have quick access to patient’s medical information when a patient is mobile.
<br /><br />
SOLUTION:  Health Allianze is the company that pulls together all your medical record data.  We solve the medical record fragmentation through the use of a KEY.
<br /><br />
Our KEY will allow you to access their family medical records and identified health risks based on trends in a patient's family tree. This will enable you to establish specific preventive care practices. This valuable tool will keep your patient's specialist and other medical providers well informed with the patient's comprehensive medical data. <br /><br />
With Health Allianze’s information technology-enabled services, you will be empowered to access and share all your healthcare records with providers at all times.
