<h3>Here is how we will work with you to reduce the staggering cost of healthcare and improve delivery and efficiency:</h3>
Insurers will have evidence-based comprehensive, non-identifiable medical information to track demographics, illness trends and statistics. Our evidence-based reports will be most valuable in analyzing health data from the start of a patient's symptoms through clinical tests, diagnosis, treatments and results.  By capturing the patient's symptoms from their personal health journal, analysis can provide preventive actions to potentially growing health problems, right from the onset. 
<br /><br />
Health Allianze products will give you the necessary information to recommend the best possible care for your clients. This will lead to a healthier lifestyle for each individual.  
<br /><br />
Doctors will have access to complete patient-specific records at the point of care, allowing them to make knowledgeable and efficient decisions. 
<br /><br />
We educate patients and encourage them to develop a better understanding of their own medical care. 
<br /><br /> 
We support and exceed the HIPAA security and privacy guidelines and are committed to the security of all technical and policy aspects of information sharing. 
<br /><br />
We will streamline claim processing, reduce costs and eliminate submitted errors.
