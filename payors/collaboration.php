As an Insurer, you are one the most significant players in the healthcare paradigm.  Your role as an advocate for Patients as their financial intermediate with their Medical Providers, positions you as the leader in ensuring that the right medical processes are provided and that they are effective.
<br /><br />
As a promoter of healthy Insured Members, you are the advocate for the “Best Quality” of medical care for them, in the most effective, efficient and cost valuable approach.  Health Allianze wants to partner with you to ensure that your Insured Members are receiving the best in what medical care has to offer.
<br /><br />
In order for your members to receive the “BEST” medical care, in many instances they need to meet with medical specialists who are expert’s respective fields.   In order for these medical experts to provide the most effective and efficient care possible, these Medical Providers (primary care doctors, cardiologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, OB/GYNs, orthopedics, pediatricians, nurses, therapists, dentists, chiropractors, etc.) must have comprehensive patient-centric medical and health information at the point of care.  Health Allianze provides a technology-enabled service that manages your Insured Members’ comprehensive patient-centric healthcare information, and gives them the ability to grant access to their Medical Providers’ so that they have the knowledge needed to collaborate with other Medical Providers to ensure the “Best” quality of care.

Health Allianze’s Members Primary Care Physician, and their supporting Medical Providers and Medical Specialists should be able to collaborate and share information that is in the “BEST” interest of the Patients.  By utilizing this <span class="emphasizePhrase">Patient-Centric Collaborative</span> care approach each Patient will receive effective and efficient medical care with better outcomes, while controlling unnecessary claims.
<br /><br />
At the current time Patient Centric Collaborative Care does not exist.  Healthcare is dispensed as a science based experiment that has its roots in scientific based methodologies.  Although effective in providing and diagnosing health issues, time to diagnosis, treatments and claims are jeopardizing the current system.  The answer to these growing concerns is a Patient-Centric Collaborative Care approach.  This will reduce costs and claims, while improving patient care and allowing the medical community a much improved method of diagnosing and treating each Patient.  Health Allianze solves this problem.
