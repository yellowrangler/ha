var tjr = "<p>When I was a young girl, my mother, who was extremely active, would scare my "+
"sister and I to death with sudden dizziness that would cause her to pass out.  My "+
"father had her go for medical tests after every episode, and no one seemed to have an "+
"idea what was happening to her.  The doctors at one point suggested that she might be "+
"more likely to have these attacks during premenstrual periods."+
"</p>"+
"<p>After several years of this, and a move across the country, my mother had a serious "+
"occurrence while at work, and was rushed to the hospital.  The doctor’s concurred that "+
"she had experienced a mild heart attack.  Of course the new doctors had absolutely "+
"no information from all of the tests she had gone through over the years.  They began "+
"to have her take same tests over, always going to a new heart specialist. "+
"</p>"+
"<p>Another heart attack, and a new physician finally uncovered the problem.  The cause of "+
"my mother’s attacks of dizziness and passing out was due to her heart valves not operating "+
"properly.  They were closing and not always opening regularly.  When closed for too long, "+
"she would not get enough blood into her system and would begin to get sick.  Diagnosis "+
"was Mitral Valve disease, with severe mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitations.  Within "+
"two weeks, my 58 year old mother had open-heart surgery to replace both of her "+
"heart valves. "+
"</p>"+
"<p>Ten years, and seven days from the surgery, my mother passed away from a massive heart "+
"attack.  When I looked back at the medical records she had accumulated, I found notes "+
"of her medical history, “she remembers illness as a child with fever and aching all "+
"over, but does not know specifically of an episode of rheumatic fever. Her two "+
"brothers had heart attacks in their forty’s which were fatal, not sure what caused "+
"of their heart attacks”.  Is there something in these records that may have helped "+
"doctors uncover my mother’s problems sooner?  Is there information about my mother’s "+
"surgery and sudden death that could be helpful to others with the same problems?  "+
"Can this information assist doctors with my care?  Understanding the answer to "+
"these questions has caused me to build this company.  I am not sure that this "+
"information could have kept my mother alive longer, or whether it may keep me from "+
"a heart attack, but I am not going to play games with my health due to a lack "+
"of information. "+

var spr ="<p>In 1983, my father was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma – kidney cancer. This is one of the most lethal "+
"kinds of cancer, with a very low survival rate. And, indeed, my father died within 5 months of his diagnosis.</p>"+
"<p>I remember the day in the hospital when my father and the rest of my family heard the news. I immediately started "+
"searching for experimental treatments – something, anything that could save my father’s life. In those pre-internet "+
"days, it was difficult to find information about my father’s disease and difficult to find out what kinds of additional "+
"treatments were available.</p>"+ 
"<p>When I brought my father to other physicians for a second opinion, and a third opinion and a fourth opinion, I "+
"recall the huge mountain of paper and film records I transported each and every time and the same questions that "+
"were asked over and over again. Caring for my father was a full-time job. I didn’t need a second job working as a "+
"secretary as well. I felt that there had to be a better way. </p>"+
"<p>Everything my colleagues and I do at Health Allianze moves us to a better future – one where patients and their "+
"families can concentrate solely on the task of getting and staying well.</p>";

var sfr ="<p>When my brother Garry was diagnosed with colon cancer our entire family went into panic mode.  Never had "+
"we experienced a life threatening illness.  We did what everyone else does and started searching for the best possible "+
"care.  We started at our local hospital in Guntersville, Alabama.  Then of course we wanted the specialist.  So off "+
"to MD Anderson we went.  MD Anderson needed files and film.  We thought that would be a simple request but it took weeks! "+ 
"And many calls and visits.  After we didn’t get the answer we wanted from MD Anderson we headed to Sloan Kettering in "+
"New York.  We had learned that before specialized oncologist will see you they need your records.  Now we were at "+
"the mercy of MD Anderson to send everything to Sloan Kettering.  The records were sent in a timely fashion but to us "+ 
"it seemed like an eternity.  Sloan Kettering sent us to another clinic where they completely lost my brother’s film!  "+
"Then we had to go back to people and ask for copies.  Every specialist we spoke to needed files.  "+
"It was difficult and time consuming to gather these bulky files and Fed Ex them every time.</p>"+
"<p>When Tammy Jamieson approached me with the Health Allianze plan, I knew how badly this was needed.  Having my "+
"brother’s medical records on line would have saved us much valuable time.  We would have contacted the doctor, "+
"e-mailed the records and would have an immediate response.  I joined the team because I know that Health Allianze "+ 
"will save lives.</p>";

var jbr ="<p>When I first met Tammy Jamieson I was intrigued with the concept and value of the Health Allianze Solution. "+
"As I began researching the need for such a service, the input and response was overwhelmingly positive as a viable solution "+
"for empowering the individual as well as their caregivers.</p>"+
"<p>Recently, I was meeting with a possible business partner at a local restaurant and as I was pitching the value "+
"proposition of the Health Allianze Solution, a senior citizen was eavesdropping on our conversation. This woman asked me "+
"when she could sign-up for the service since she has a serious heart condition that needs monitoring and she travels "+
"frequently from her home in Massachusetts to Florida.  Since her ailment can be life threatening she travels with her "+
"EKG records and other documentation in a plastic pouch. Although cumbersome, her physician told her to carry this information "+
"and records so that she can be treated accordingly in the case of an emergency. She further explained that she is a believer "+
"in technology and every senior citizen should be enrolled in the service.</p>"+
"<p>If I can help contribute to that woman’s welfare as well as all patients and their families, then I truly believe that "+
"I have made a positive impact on society.</p>";

var rjr ="<p>I have always enjoyed working in the field of medicine, whether it was giving hands on care, or working in a "+
"management capacity, it has all added up to a pretty exciting career.   My ultimate goal has always been about what is best "+
"for the patient, the patient’s family, and the staff that give the incredible care to these individuals.</p>"+
"<p>Now that I have a chance to look back and see the road traveled; I see an opportunity to give even more, by being "+
"involved with a company that is interested in giving the patient (consumer) the ability to better manage their own care.  "+
"In other words, they will have increased control of their medical destiny. Their destiny lies within their medical history "+
"otherwise known as the medical record. They will have that knowledge at their fingertips, and knowledge is what gives "+
"power to make decisions…good decisions.</p>";

var tmr ="<p>My life’s passion is to improve the quality and value of health care.  I became a registered nurse with the goal "+
"of providing the best patient care possible as a caregiver.  I expanded upon my goal by teaching the next generation of "+
"health care providers.  My goal grew to encompass improving health care at the policy level.  Health Allianze is allowing "+
"me the opportunity to make an even greater impact by utilizing a patient-centric philosophy with medical records.</p>"+
"<p>My father suffered a life threatening traumatic brain injury. He was first treated at his local hospital. He was "+
"immediately sent by ambulance to Boston, where brain surgery was performed to save his life.  He was unconscious and "+
"on a respirator for a month.  He was sent to a rehabilitation hospital for the next month.  He then came to live with me "+
"for a month while receiving physical, occupational and speech therapies.  He eventually returned to his home.  A short "+
"time later, he fell while walking and was taken to his local hospital emergency room.  Upon his admission, he was asked "+
"if he had any medical history.  He said no.  My father had no recollection, since he was unconscious during his "+
"hospitalization and confused while he was at the rehabilitation facility.  Fortunately, the astute emergency room "+
"physician noticed his craniotomy scar.  However, the emergency room had no access to any of his medical records from "+
"the Boston hospital, or any other facility where he had received patient care. </p>"+
"<p>Health Allianze assures health care providers that they are making decisions based on accurate medical documentation "+
"and allows patients the peace of mind knowing they carry complete health care information wherever and whenever they "+
"need care. It provides continuity and accuracy of medical information and expedites time spent in critical situations.  "+
"Health Allianze has developed an essential product that will improve patient outcomes and save lives.</p>";

var rgr = "<p>My reason for joining, is simple, a former colleague (Tammy) asked to help with the building and development of Health Allianze.</p>"; 

var tcr = "<p>The focus of medical institutions is to provide quality healthcare with their member partners. "+
"They want to ensure that their Patients/Clients are receiving quality care, which creates loyalty and a basis for continued services. The problem with that model is that it places the institution at the center of the universe. " +
"Additionally, unless the medical institutions are electronically linked with their partners, then patient information even within "+
"the institution might be incomplete.</p><p>I beleive the only way to true patient healtcare is through self advocacy. But to be able to truly "+
"advocate for yourself, you must have information. That is where HeathAllinze comes in. The Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) has made it clear that patients own their "+
"medical information. By acting as a patient proxy we can gather all your medcial information so that you will be able to walk into "+
"any medical institution prepared. I beleive in the patience centric model. That's why I joind HealthAllianze.</p>";
