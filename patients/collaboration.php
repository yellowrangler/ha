In order for you to get the “BEST” medical care, you will need to see medical specialists who have dedicated their lives to be experts in understanding and caring for specific areas of your body. In order for these medical experts to provide the most effective and efficient care, they must know your healthcare history. This should include all of your Medical Providers such as, (primary care doctor, cardiologist, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, OB/GYN, orthopedic, pediatrician, nurse, therapist, dentist, chiropractor, etc).  In other words those who have treated and diagnosed you.
<br /><br />
Patients, who have had a local doctor care for their parents from birth to adult years, have experienced a form of collaborative care. This is because of one doctor’s knowledge and information about that individual, which includes Patient and family history.
<br /><br />
In today’s society this is not the norm due to medical specializations and focused expertise. Each Patient has a primary care doctor that is chosen from their insurance provider’s list. Based upon initial symptoms and diagnosis, the Patient meets with and consults with a specialist for each unique and specific medical issue. A Patient’s medical information and history is not shared between the various Medical Providers they encounter, in other words there is no collaboration.
A Patient must try to provide prior healthcare history explaining what prior Medical Providers have tested and diagnosed. This lack of information then requires that a doctor must go through duplicate tests and procedures because medical records are not readily available and shared with their various Medical Providers. This methodology does not constitute effective and efficient medical care. It is costly, time consuming and risky for the Patient’s care.
