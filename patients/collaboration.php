In order for you to get the BEST medical care, you will need to see medical specialist who have dedicated their lives to be experts in caring for specific areas of your body.  In order for these medical experts to provide the most effective and efficient care for you, they must know what all of your medical providers (primary care doctor, cardiologist, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, OB/GYN, orthopedic, pediatrician, nurse, therapist, dentist, chiropractor, etc) have tested, diagnosed and treated you for.   
<br /><br />
Patients, who had a local doctor care for their parents and care for them from their birth, have experienced a form of collaborative care due to one doctor’s knowledge of their family history and entire medical care.   
<br /><br />
However, today this is not the medical care experience of patient’s.  They have a primary care doctor chosen from their insurance list, and see a specialist for each unique and specific medical issue.  A patient’s medical information is not shared between the medical provider’s they encounter.  There is no collaboration.  A patient must try to explain what prior medical providers
<span style="margin:auto;">
<img border="0" style="padding:10px;" align="right" height="300" src="/ha/images/Sabrina gives Nurse KEY.JPG">
</span>
have tested and diagnosed.  They must go through duplicate tests and procedures because medical records are not shared amount their medical providers.  This is NOT effective and efficient medical care.  It is costly, time consuming and risky for the patient’s care.    
<br /><br />
Health Allianze solves this problem.  We give the patient a technology KEY that the allows them to give their medical providers’ collaborative, comprehensive medical and health information at the point of care, anywhere in the world, at any time.
<br /><br />
Health Allianze works with the patient to manage this private medical and health information securely.  The patient grants access to their medical providers and healthcare supporters exactly when they need accurate, valuable medical information of all of their care.
<br /><br />
If you believe that “The first wealth is health” (by Ralph Waldo Emerson), then you need to have your comprehensive medical and health information for patient-centric knowledge-based, collaborative medical care every time you see a medical provider.
