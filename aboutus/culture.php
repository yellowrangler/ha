<h3>Goals</h3>
Making patient-centric information available for medical providers at the point of care to medical providers anywhere in the world, at any time, even though a patient may move from insurer to insurer, from one doctor to another, from one geographic location to another 
<br /><br />
Giving patients direct control over the distribution of their medical and health information through the use of the KEY.  
<br /><br />
Empowering the patient to access and share all their healthcare records with providers through the use of the KEY
<br /><br />
